# Playbook for creating OpenStack IDR VMs

# WARNING: Do not use set_facts in this role, since it'll create a hostvar
# on the host running the openstack client and not the VM created.
# This means multiple invocations of this role (for multiple VMs) will fail
# to work as expected since the hostvar is persistent across tasks.
# See defaults/main.yml for most of the logic.

# If you have multiple networks with external connectivity you should specify
# the network the floating should be atfached too, otherwise it may be random
# which is almost certainly not what you want.
